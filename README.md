# hello-world
First git in my step into this world

## What I am going to do in here:
So my idea of git became by the evolution of cinema & VFX: VR

By this idea, and some other technologies I saw that I could relate, became to my mind to develop tech, starting from software and, who knows, probably some day in hardware.

BTW I love to design, so create my own tech could be freacking amazing. 

### And what about you and your "coolness"?
Well, I talk shit to my proper chicks just to feel cool today. 

### No, but seriusly. Alocoifindo? Where comes that name from?
Hey, chill, I don't have all responses. Is a name that came to my mind I don't know when. Is true that –A lo loco voy y sin fin, Tho'–, so if you were talking about coolness, mine it's too personal.

## Nice to meet you
Nice to... write you.
